[theme]

# Here you can define the color theme used by pubs, if enabled in the

# https://github.com/pubs/pubs/blob/master/extra/themes.md

# Available colors are: 'black', 'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue', 'purple',
# 'cyan', and 'grey'. Bold colors are available by prefixing 'b' in front of
# the color name ('bblack', 'bred', etc.), italic colors by prefixing 'i',
# and bold italic by prefixing 'bi'. Finally, 'bold', 'italic' and
# 'bolditalic' can be used to apply formatting without changing the color.
# For no color, use an empty string ''
